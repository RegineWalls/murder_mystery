		Warren: A man need not cry to show his grief. Quite poetic don't you think?
		<br/><br/>
		You: Indeed it is.

		Warren: An artist shows his emotions in different mediums whether through a brush or a pen. Not everybody would understand that. Especially Hank.
		<br/><br/>
		Warren monologues and you just listen as he speaks, as you heard him point at Hank, so you decide to talk to him.
