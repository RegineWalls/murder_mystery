		You decided to approach Hank. You seemed like he was the most logical person to speak with. He was staring at the lifeless body of Charles. He seemed like he was analyzing him but all he did was just stare.
		<br/><br/>
		You: Excuse me Hank, I would like to ask you...
		<br/><br/>
		As you were about to ask Hank a question, he glared at you and said sternly..
		<br/><br/>
		Hank: That's professor Hank to you...
		<br/><br/>
		You: Okay, professor, I need to ask you something?
		<br/><br/>
		In your mind, you wanted to ask hank about what he thinks his relationship with his father, but also in you mind you wanted to know how he thinks he is chosen as suspect.
